and that was within my college where I was studying IT. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Forest scene</h3>
    <p>
	This is my first programming project at City, and I decided to make a small piano game to show 
my understanding of if keys, shapes, velocity/increments and editing shapes. Firstly I made a template
with rectangles of the piano itself, adding text for each key that flashes when pressed so that the user
  knows which key is which. I then started to make the ellipses that travel at different speeds, and when
they collide with a certain y angle and a key is pressed will disappear correctly (aim is to keep it clear),
 if not they will start to clutter up.
